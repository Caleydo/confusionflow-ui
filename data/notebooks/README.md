## Usage of Jupyter Notebooks

Make sure that you install the required packages first using `conda`.

It's recommended to simply create a new environment (based on `python2`) using the following command:
```
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

After installation you can start `Jupyterlab` via `jupyter lab` and access the notebooks under `localhost:8888`.
